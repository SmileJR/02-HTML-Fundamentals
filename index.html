      <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <!--em means italics--><em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
       <!--WE WILL BE USING STRONG FOR HTML CAPS-->
       HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper</strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage.
      It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
      </p>
      <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
        etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:

        <!-- THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF AN ORDERED LIST-->
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
        </p>
      </ol>
        <!-- THIS IS THE END OF AN ORDERED LIST-->
              <p>You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="blank"/>MDN Web Docs.</a></p>
      <!-- THIS HEADING WILL HAVE A THICKER FONT THAN THE ORDERED LIST -->
      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

      <!-- THIS PARAGRAPH PRECEDES THE UNORDERED LIST -->
      <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
      
      <!-- THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE UNORDERED LIST -->
      <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
<!--THIS IS THE END OF THE UNORDERED LIST-->
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
